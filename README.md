Some projects I've worked on during my 2nd year in IMT Atlantique
* Parallel Computing with Julia: constrained optimization using parallel computing in Julia to denoise a hyperspectral image.
* Survival Analysis with Python, lifelines : a quick implementation of Kaplan-Meier and Cox-PH models on Telcon Customer Churn dataset. Objective: analyse the influence of features on the churn and tenure of customers.
